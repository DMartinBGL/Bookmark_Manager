# Bookmark Manager

An exemplar of the Bookmark Manager application, with sensible commits.

## Getting Started

If you clone this app from the Initial Commit, you will have a ready-to-go application with RSpec, Sinatra, and Capybara installed. There's a small smoke test, too.

```
git clone https://github.com/sjmog/bookmark_manager
cd bookmark_manager
bundle install
rspec
```

If you see a passing test, you're good to go!
